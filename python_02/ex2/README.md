> Create 3 custom exception classes, raise them in functions, catch them with try/except, and demonstrate that a parent error class can catch all child errors.
> This exercise teaches how to create custom exception classes, use inheritance to organize related errors, and handle them with try/except. Custom errors make programs clearer and more specific than Python’s built-in exceptions. Inheritance allows catching either specific errors or all garden-related errors using a base class.
