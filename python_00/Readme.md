# 🌿 Growing Code: Python Fundamentals

**Python Fundamentals Through Garden Data**

> *"Programming, like gardening, is about nurturing growth—both in code and in the communities we serve."*

Welcome to **Growing Code**! This project creates a bridge between community gardening and computer science. Through a series of exercises, we analyze garden data—from tracking harvest yields to monitoring water usage—to learn the fundamental building blocks of Python.
